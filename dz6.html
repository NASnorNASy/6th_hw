            <h2><b>William Shakespeare</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>
            <p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet,<br> playwright and actor,
                widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language<br> and the world's greatest dramatist.
                He is often called England's national poet and the<br> "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including
                collaborations, consist of approximately<br> 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few
                other verses, some of<br> uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living
                language<br> and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age<br> of 18, he married
                Anne
                Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and<br> twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between
                1585
                and 1592, he began a successful<br> career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing
                company called the<br> Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613),
                he<br>
                appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of<br> Shakespeare's
                private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about<br> such matters as his
                physical
                appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and<br> whether the works attributed to him were
                written
                by others. Such theories are often<br> criticised for failing to adequately note that few records
                survive of
                most commoners<br> of the period.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early<br> plays were primarily
                comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best<br> work produced in these genres. Until
                about
                1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among<br> them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered
                to
                be among the finest<br> works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote
                tragicomedies<br>
                (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
                <br>
                <br>
                Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and<br> accuracy in his
                lifetime.
                However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of<br> Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                published a more definitive text<br> known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of
                Shakespeare's dramatic<br> works that included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a
                poem<br>
                by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote<br> as "not of an
                age,
                but for all time".
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually<br> adapted and
                rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His<br> plays remain popular and are
                studied,
                performed, and reinterpreted through various<br> cultural and political contexts around the world.
